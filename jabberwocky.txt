Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe.
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jujub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!
He took his vorpal sword in hand
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum gree
And stood awhile in thought.
And as in uffish thought he stood
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Came whiffling through the tulgey wook
And burbled as it came!
One, two!  One, two!  And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.
And has thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day!  Calloh!  Callay!
He chortled in his joy.
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

A boat, beneath a sunny sky
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of July

Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear
Pleased a simple tale to hear

Long has paled that sunny sky
Echoes fade and memories die
Autumn frosts have slain July.

Still she haunts me, phantomwise
Alice moving under skies
Never seen by waking eyes.

Children yet, the tale to hear,
Eager eye and willing ear,
Lovingly shall nestle near.

In a Wonderland they lie,
Dreaming as the days go by,
Dreaming as the summers die

Ever drifting down the stream
Lingering in the golden gleam
Life what is it but a dream?
